## Problem Description

To start with, [nginx](https://github.com/nginx/nginx) is an open-source software powering millions of servers all around the world. It was always free and its source code is available to everyone.

On Thursday, December 12, law enforcement agencies searched the Moscow office of Nginx. The founders of the company Igor Sysoev and Maxim Konovalov, according to some reports, spent several hours at the interrogation. The reason for the investigative actions was a statement from the company associated with businessman Alexander Mamut - co-owner of Rambler Group holding. In the structures of the businessman believe that the rights to the web server Nginx belong to them, as Sysoev began its development in the course of work in Rambler in 2004.
